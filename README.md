This is my portfolio site

I began with a simple layout in mind, a title + nav bar at the top, a quick & catchy phrase and then my work below.

# Nav Bar

The nav bar has just four links with 'home', 'about', 'work', and 'contact' links.

# Hero Section

I wanted to put a nice animated phrase that had a deeper meaning but also was related to the services I could potentially offer.

# About

Tongue in cheek but with a flavor of seriousness.

# Work

I don't have any real 'work' to post here so I grabbed some of the worst websited I could find! I hope you enjoy the mind melt that is my "Work" section!

# Contact

Added three simple buttons for contact, I like having the SMS feature b/c I think it adds a hint of modern communication methods. I think going forward, adding a Calendly link would work well in a situation like this. No?

Thanks! Made with Love and Potato Salad.
